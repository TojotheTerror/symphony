# Symphony

Symphony turns project work into isolated, autonomous implementation runs, allowing teams to manage
work instead of supervising coding agents.

[![Symphony demo video preview](.github/media/symphony-demo-poster.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1186371009?h=5626e4b899)

_In this [demo video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1186371009?h=5626e4b899), Symphony monitors a Linear board for work and spawns agents to handle the tasks. The agents complete the tasks and provide proof of work: CI status, PR review feedback, complexity analysis, and walkthrough videos. When accepted, the agents land the PR safely. Engineers do not need to supervise Codex; they can manage the work at a higher level._

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony is a low-key engineering preview for testing in trusted environments.

## Running Symphony

### Requirements

Symphony works best in codebases that have adopted
[harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/). Symphony is the next step --
moving from managing coding agents to managing work that needs to get done.

### TypeScript v0 scaffold

This repository is bootstrapping a custom TypeScript + Node.js implementation. The upstream Elixir
implementation remains prototype/reference material only and is not the implementation path for
this scaffold.

Install dependencies and run the local checks:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

The current CLI is intentionally limited to scaffold and safety checks:

```bash
npm run start -- --help
npm run start -- safety check --write-target TojotheTerror/symphony
```

Repository-boundary rules are documented in [docs/repo-boundary.md](docs/repo-boundary.md). The
root [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) is a draft only until CODEX-48 implements and tests workflow
loading, config validation, and Linear `symphony-ready` gating.

### Option 1. Make your own

Tell your favorite coding agent to build Symphony in a programming language of your choice:

> Implement Symphony according to the following spec:
> https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md

### Option 2. Use our experimental reference implementation

Check out [elixir/README.md](elixir/README.md) for instructions on how to set up your environment
and run the Elixir-based Symphony implementation. You can also ask your favorite coding agent to
help with the setup:

> Set up Symphony for my repository based on
> https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/elixir/README.md
